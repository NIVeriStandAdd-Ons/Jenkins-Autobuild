## Jenkins Autobuild ##

**Jenkins Autobuild** is a set of files used to launch LabVIEW builds from [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/). This is an expansion of JKI's files and video posted on [their blog](http://blog.jki.net/news/niweek-2012-fire-and-forget-bulletproof-builds-using-continuous-integration-with-labview-video-slides-now-available/). The main addition from JKI's files is the ability to do builds in multiple versions of LabVIEW as well as build steps through autobuild.csv files.
